# DroidBot2Core

This is a core library for droidbot2 and can be used with any Discord4J bot instance


# IMPORTANT NOTE!
This has NOT been updated for Java 9 yet. Please wait as I test out the functions of this and see if they work the same on Java 9 as they did on Java 8.

# Planned Additions:

Custom File Class:
- Will allow for a File.exists() check to make the file exist if it doesn't.
- File read errors will be auto printed to Owner's Discord Chat.
- Possible: Auto make all System.out.println() go to a specified channel or DM through another class extention.
